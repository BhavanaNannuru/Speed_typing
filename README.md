"Speed Typing" is an ongoing project that aims to refine users' typing proficiency, currently operating with a limited set of sentences. The prototype displays a sentence and triggers the timer upon the first keystroke after sentence presentation. Upon completion, the project showcases elapsed time, accuracy, and words per minute (WPM) metrics. However, certain issues, such as the display of negative values due to extra spaces entered, are actively being addressed. Enhancements encompass expanding the sentence database and designing a comprehensive user interface for an optimal typing practice experience.
